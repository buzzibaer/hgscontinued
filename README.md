## Healing Group Sucks Continued

Update on the famous Healing Group Sucks Addon
Due to disappearing of the original Author i made some Updates to make it work


Healing Groups Suck is a GUI for creating, broadcasting, and saving healing groups during raids.

To use, join a raid group (it won't detect healers in a 5-man party), open the main window by either clicking on the HGS button or typing '/hgs open', and click the Refresh button to populate the list on the left with the current healers in the raid.

Enter the channel name you want to broadcast to in the channel box and hit enter. This can be 'say', 'yell', 'party', 'raid', channel names, or channel numbers. You'll see the text update with something like 'sending to Party'.

When you click on healer names in the list on the left, they'll be added to the active group, which has it's name displayed in the top left. To change the active group either click on the big red group name buttons, or enter a custom group name in the text box and save it by pressing enter. The group name will update. You can click on the healers in the groups to remove them from that group, and you can click on the Clear button to clear all healers from the current set. The number of currently assigned and total healers is under the active group name in the upper left.

You can also use the 'I'm Lazy' button to evenly distribute the unallocated healers to all groups with custom names. For example you can now easily enter the names of 3 tanks, click the 'I'm Lazy' button, and post groups. You can set group names back to default by hitting enter in an empty text box.

You can use the text box at the bottom to save a name for each set (which will also be broadcast) and the arrows to switch between them. You can save 30 different sets which should probably be way more than anybody will ever use.

Click Broadcast or type '/hgs broadcast'. Only groups with assigned healers will be sent.

People can also whisper you with 'hgs' or 'HGS' and you will reply to them with their healing assignment. It will use the current HGS Set on the to look up assignments.
